# Cost Optimization Pillar
The cost optimization pillar includes the continual process of refinement and improvement of a system over its entire lifecycle to constantly look for ways to reduce costs. From your initial design to the ongoing operations of production workloads, adopting the practices specified in this document will help you to build and operate cost-aware systems. By doing so, you can achieve cost-effective business outcomes and maximize your return on investment.

# Design Principles
In the cloud, there are a number of principles that can help you achieve cost optimization of your microservices:

+ Ensure that microservices are disposable—that is, the microservices are based on disposable and immutable containers. By ensuring that containers are disposable, recovering from a server failure is fast as the containers can be moved to different servers easily. When containers are based on immutable images, the containers can be upgraded to new versions by updating the image, deploying it, and then disposing of the old image.
+ Ensure that microservices are independent of specific infrastructure types for running your containers—so that microservices can scale out independently on heterogeneous infrastructure. There can be exceptions like workloads that [require a GPU](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-gpu.html) or a specific type of server.
+ Select optimally profiled container instances—profile your production or pre-production environments and monitor critical metrics. like CPU and memory, using [Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights for Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy-container-insights-EKS.html). 
+ Take advantage of the different purchasing options that are available in AWS, e.g. On-Demand, Spot, and Reserved Instances.

# Definition
There are four general best practice areas for cost optimization in the cloud:

+ Cost-effective resources
+ Matching supply and demand
+ Expenditure awareness
+ Optimizing over time

As with the other pillars, there are trade-offs to consider. For example, do you want to optimize for speed to market or for cost? In some cases, it’s best to optimize for speed—going to market quickly, shipping new features, or simply meeting a deadline—rather than investing in upfront cost optimization. Design decisions are sometimes guided by haste as opposed to empirical data, as the temptation always exists to overcompensate “just in case” rather than spend time benchmarking for the most cost-optimal deployment. This often leads to drastically over-provisioned and under-optimized deployments. 

## Best Practices

### Cost-effective resources
**Ensure that the infrastructure used to deploy the containerized service matches the application profile and scaling needs. Use pricing models for effective utilization.**

Amazon EKS on AWS supports running the worker nodes on clusters using either EC2 Instance types or AWS Fargate, and on premises using AWS Outposts. Amazon EC2 based worker nodes can be either On-Demand Instances or Amazon EC2 Spot Instances. It has different pricing models for the Fargate launch type that are based on the amount of vCPU and memory resources that your containerized application requests. With an EC2 launch type, you pay for AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and Load Balancers) that you create to store and run your application. [There are important considerations that need to be taken into account before running using AWS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html#fargate-considerations).
EC2 Spot Instances offer spare compute capacity available in the AWS Cloud at steep discounts compared to On-Demand Instances. Spot Instances typically cost 50–90% less than On-Demand Instances. Powering your EKS cluster with Spot Instances lets you reduce the cost of running your existing containerized workloads, or increase your compute capacity by two to ten times while keeping the same budget.Or you could do a combination of running a cluster with both On-Demand as well as Spot Instances. 
The right strategy will depend upon a number of factors—including the application architecture's ability to run on Spot Instances, and the need to maintain a minimum amount of core compute capacity regardless of the availability of Spot Instances. There are [reference architectures that show how automatic scaling with a mix of On-Demand and Spot Instances can be architected in an EKS Cluster](https://eksworkshop.com/spotworkers/workers/). 
For AWS Fargate, you only pay for the amount of vCPU and memory resources that your containerized application requests. AWS Fargate pricing is calculated based on the vCPU and memory resources used from the time you start to download your container image until the Amazon EKS Pod terminates, rounded up to the nearest second. [When pods are scheduled on Fargate, the vCPU and memory reservations within the pod specification determine how much CPU and memory to provision for the pod](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-pod-configuration.html). 

**Monitoring overall CPU and memory utilization of the Container Cluster to ensure that you are using the right EC2 instance type**

### Matching supply and demand

### Expenditure awareness
Amazon EKS supports adding AWS tags to your Amazon EKS clusters. This makes it easy to control access to the EKS API for managing your clusters. Tags added to an EKS cluster are specific to the AWS EKS cluster resource, they do not propagate to other AWS resources used by the cluster such as EC2 instances or Load balancers. Today, cluster tagging is supported for all new and existing EKS clusters via the AWS API, Console, and SDKs. 

Adding and Listing tags to an EKS cluster:
```
$ aws eks tag-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:xxx:cluster/ekscluster1 --tags team=devops,env=staging,bu=cio,costcenter=1234 
$ aws eks list-tags-for-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:xxx:cluster/ekscluster1
{
    "tags": {
        "bu": "cio", 
        "env": "staging", 
        "costcenter": "1234", 
        "team": "devops"
    }
}
```

### Optimizing over time

Leverage Auto Scaling at a service level as well on container nodes, to provision resources and keep a buffer for traffic spikes. Leverage pricing models to gain efficiency for burst and spike modes.

### Key AWS Services
Cost optimization is supported by the following AWS services and features:
+ Cost-effective resources – Amazon EC2 provides multiple instance types, such as Reserved Instances and Spot Instances, at different prices.
+ Matching supply and demand – Match user demand with Auto Scaling. Consider Savings Plan (Previously Reserved Instances) for predictable workloads. Use managed data stores for elasticity and durability of the application data.
+ Expenditure awareness – The Billing and Cost Management console dashboard provides an overview of your AWS usage. Use AWS Organizations for granular billing details.
+ Optimizing over time – Amazon CloudWatch Container Metrics provides metrics around usage of resources by the EKS cluster. In addition to the Kubernetes dashboard, there are several tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem that can be used to monitor Kubernetes clusters, such as Prometheus.
