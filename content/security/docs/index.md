# Security Best Practices Guide
The Security pillar includes the ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

## Definition
There are five best practice areas for Security in the cloud:

+ Identity and access management 
+ Detective controls
+ Infrastructure protection
+ Data protection
+ Incident response

Before you architect any system, you need to think about its security implications and the practices that can affect your security posture. For example, you need to control who can perform actions against a set of resources. You also need the ability to quickly identify security incidents, protect your systems and services from unauthorized access, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection. Having a well-defined and rehearsed process for responding to security incidents will help too. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.
