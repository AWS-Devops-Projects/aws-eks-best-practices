# Security Best Practices Guide
This guide provides advice to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.

## Definition
There are several best practice areas that are pertinent when using a managed Kubernetes service like EKS:

+ Identity and access management 
+ Pod Security
+ Runtime Security
+ Network Security
+ Multi-tenancy
+ Detective Controls
+ Infrastructure Security
+ Data Encryption and Secrets Management
+ Regulatory Compliance
+ Incident Response

Before you architect any system, you need to think about its security implications and the practices that can affect your security posture. For example, you need to control who can perform actions against a set of resources. You also need the ability to quickly identify security incidents, protect your systems and services from unauthorized access, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection. Having a well-defined and rehearsed process for responding to security incidents will help too. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.

AWS helps organizations achieve their security and compliance goals by offering a rich set of security services that have evolved based on feedback from a broad set of security conscious customers. By offering a highly secure foundation, customers can spend less time on “undifferentiated heavy lifting” and more time on achieving their business objectives.
