# Expenditure awareness

Expenditure awareness is understanding who, where and what is spending causing expenditure in your EKS cluster. Getting a clear idea of this data will help in awareness and to remediate wasteful costs.

### Tagging of Resources

Amazon EKS supports [adding AWS tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eks-using-tags.html) to your Amazon EKS clusters. This makes it easy to control access to the EKS API for managing your clusters. Tags added to an EKS cluster are specific to the AWS EKS cluster resource, they do not propagate to other AWS resources used by the cluster such as EC2 instances or Load balancers. Today, cluster tagging is supported for all new and existing EKS clusters via the AWS API, Console, and SDKs.

Adding and Listing tags to an EKS cluster:
```
$ aws eks tag-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:xxx:cluster/ekscluster1 --tags team=devops,env=staging,bu=cio,costcenter=1234
$ aws eks list-tags-for-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:xxx:cluster/ekscluster1
{
    "tags": {
        "bu": "cio",
        "env": "staging",
        "costcenter": "1234",
        "team": "devops"
    }
}
```
After you activate cost allocation tags in the [AWS Cost Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html), AWS uses the cost allocation tags to organize your resource costs on your cost allocation report, to make it easier for you to categorize and track your AWS costs.

Tags don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon EKS and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. For example, you can define a set of tags for your Amazon EKS clusters to help you track each cluster's owner and stack level.

## Recommendations
### 2.2 Use AWS Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor offers a rich set of best practice checks and recommendations across five categories: cost optimization; security; fault tolerance; performance; and service limits.

Under Cost Optimization, it helps in eliminating unused and idle resources or making commitments to reserved capacity. The key action items that will help Amazon EKS with EC2 will be around low utilsed EC2 instances, unassociated Elastic IP addresses, Idle Load Balancers, underutilized EBS volumes among other things. The complete list of checks are provided at https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/best-practice-checklist/. 

The Trusted Advisor also provides Savings Plan and Reserved Instances recommendations for EC2 instances and Fargate - which allows you to commit to a consistent usage amount in exchange for discounted rates. Please note, that the recommendations from Trusted Advisor are generic recommendations and not specific to EKS.

### Use the Kubernetes dashboard 

***Kubernetes dashboard***

Kubernetes Dashboard is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters, which provides information about the Kubernetes cluster including the resource usage at a cluster, node and pod level. The deployment of the Kubernetes dashboard on an Amazon EKS cluster is described in the [Amazon EKS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/dashboard-tutorial.html). 

Dashboard provides resource usage breakdowns for each node and pod, as well as detailed metadata about pods, services, Deployments, and other Kubernetes objects. This consolidated information provides visibility into your Kubernetes environment.

![Kubernetes Dashboard](../images/kubernetes-dashboard.png)

***kubectl top and describe commands***

Viewing resource usage metrics with kubectl top and kubectl describe commands. kubectl top will show current CPU and memory usage for the pods or nodes across your cluster, or for a specific pod or node. The kubectl describe command will give more detailed information about a specific node or a pod.
```
$ kubectl top pods
$ kubectl top nodes
$ kubectl top pod pod-name --namespace mynamespace --containers
```

Using the top command, the output will displays the total amount of CPU (in cores) and memory (in MiB) that the node is using, and the percentages of the nodeâ€™s allocatable capacity those numbers represent. You can then drill-down to the next level, container level within pods by adding a *--containers* flag. 


```
$ kubectl describe node <node>
$ kubectl describe pod <pod>
```

*kubectl describe* returns the percent of total available capacity that each resource request or limit represents. 

kubectl top and describe, track the utilization and availability of critical resources such as CPU, memory, and storage across kubernetes pods, nodes and containers. This awareness will help in understanding resource usage and help in controlling costs. 


### Using Container Insights on Amazon EKS and Kubernetess

Use [CloudWatch Container Insights](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy-container-insights-EKS.html) to collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs from your containerized applications and microservices. Container Insights is available for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service on EC2, and Kubernetes platforms on Amazon EC2. The metrics include utilization for resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and network. 

The installation of insights is given in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy-container-insights-EKS.html).

CloudWatch creates aggregated metrics at the cluster, node, pod, task, and service level as CloudWatch metrics. 

**The following query shows a list of nodes, sorted by average node CPU utilization**
```
STATS avg(node_cpu_utilization) as avg_node_cpu_utilization by NodeName
| SORT avg_node_cpu_utilization DESC 
```

**CPU usage by Container name**
```
stats pct(container_cpu_usage_total, 50) as CPUPercMedian by kubernetes.container_name 
| filter Type="Container"
```
**Disk usage by Container name**
```
stats floor(avg(container_filesystem_usage/1024)) as container_filesystem_usage_avg_kb by InstanceId, kubernetes.container_name, device 
| filter Type="ContainerFS" 
| sort container_filesystem_usage_avg_kb desc
```

More sample queries are given in the [Container Insights documention](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Container-Insights-view-metrics.html)

This awareness will help in understanding resource usage and help in controlling costs.



### Using KubeCost for expenditure awareness and guidance

There are third party tools like [kubecost](https://kubecost.com/), which can also be deployed on Amazon EKS to get visibility into spend of your Kubernetes cluster.

Deploying kubecost using Helm 3:
```
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
$ helm version --short
v3.2.1+gfe51cd1
$ helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
$ helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/c^C
$ kubectl create namespace kubecost

## Other tools

### Kube janitor

[Kubernetes Janitor](https://github.com/hjacobs/kube-janitor) cleans up (deletes) Kubernetes resources on (1) a configured TTL (time to live) or (2) a configured expiry date (absolute timestamp). 
The resources can also include unused Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) on Amazon EBS, which can result in substantial savings over time.

Installation of kube-janitor:
```
git clone https://github.com/hjacobs/kube-janitor
cd kube-janitor
kubectl apply -k deploy/
```

The example configuration uses the --dry-run as a safety flag to prevent any deletion --- remove it to enable the janitor, e.g. by editing the deployment:
```
$ kubectl edit deploy kube-janitor
```

To see the janitor in action, deploy a simple nginx and annotate it accordingly:
```
$ kubectl run temp-nginx --image=nginx
$ kubectl annotate deploy temp-nginx janitor/ttl=5m
```
You should see the temp-nginx deployment being deleted after 5 minutes.

More advanced cleanup scenarios are described in the [kube-janitor github project](https://github.com/hjacobs/kube-janitor).

### Kubernetes Garbage Collection

The role of the [Kubernetes garbage collector](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/) is to delete certain objects that once had an owner, but no longer have an owner.

### Fargate count

[Fargatecount](https://github.com/mreferre/fargatecount) is an useful tool, which allows AWS customers to track, with a custom CloudWatch metric, the total number of EKS pods that have been deployed on Fargate in a specific region of a specific account. This helps in keeping track of all the Fargate pods running across an EKS cluster.

### Kubernetes Ops View

[Kube Ops View](https://github.com/hjacobs/kube-ops-view) is an useful tool, which provides a common operational picture visually for multiple Kubernetes clusters.

```
git clone https://github.com/hjacobs/kube-ops-view
cd kube-ops-view
kubectl apply -k deploy/
```
