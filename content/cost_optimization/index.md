# Amazon EKS Best Practices Guide for Cost Optimization 

The cost optimization best practices includes the continual process of refinement and improvement of a system over its entire lifecycle to constantly look for ways to reduce costs. From your initial design to the ongoing operations of production workloads, adopting the practices specified in this document will help you to build and operate cost-aware systems. By doing so, you can achieve cost-effective business outcomes and maximize your return on investment.

# General Guidelines

In the cloud, there are a number of general guidelines that can help you achieve cost optimization of your microservices:
+ Ensure that workloads running on Amazon EKS are independent of specific infrastructure types for running your containers, this will give greater flexibility with regards to running them on the least expensive types of infrastructure. While using Amazon EKS with EC2, there can be exceptions when we have workloads that require specific type of EC2 Instance types like [requiring a GPU](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/gpu-ami.html) or  other instance types, due to the nature of the workload.
+ Select optimally profiled container instances — profile your production or pre-production environments and monitor critical metrics like CPU and memory, using services like [Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights for Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/deploy-container-insights-EKS.html) or third party tools that are available in the Kubernetes ecosystem. This will ensure that we can allocate the right amount of resources and avoid  wastage of resources.
+ Take advantage of the different purchasing options that are available in AWS for running EKS with EC2, e.g. On-Demand, Spot and Savings Plan.

# Best Practices for Cost Optimization

There are three general best practice areas for cost optimization in the cloud:

+ Cost-effective resources (Auto Scaling, Down Scaling, Policies and Purchasing Options)
+ Expenditure awareness (Using AWS and third party tools)
+ Optimizing over time (Right Sizing)

As with the other best practices, there are trade-offs to consider. For example, do you want to optimize for speed to market or for cost? In some cases, it’s best to optimize for speed—going to market quickly, shipping new features, or simply meeting a deadline—rather than investing in upfront cost optimization. Design decisions are sometimes guided by haste as opposed to empirical data, as the temptation always exists to overcompensate “just in case” rather than spend time benchmarking for the most cost-optimal deployment. This often leads to drastically over-provisioned and under-optimized deployments. 

### Key AWS Services
Cost optimization is supported by the following AWS services and features:
+ Cost-effective resources – Amazon EC2 provides multiple instance types, as well as Savibgs Plan (and Reserved Instances) and Spot Instances, at different prices.
+ Matching supply and demand – Match user demand with Auto Scaling along with Kubernetes native Auto Scaling policies. Consider Savings Plan (Previously Reserved Instances) for predictable workloads. Use managed data stores like EBS and EFS, for elasticity and durability of the application data.
+ Expenditure awareness – The Billing and Cost Management console dashboard  along with AWS Cost Explorer provides an overview of your AWS usage. Use AWS Organizations for granular billing details. Details of several third party tools have also been shared. 
+ Optimizing over time – Amazon CloudWatch Container Metrics provides metrics around usage of resources by the EKS cluster. In addition to the Kubernetes dashboard, there are several tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem that can be used to reduce wastage.

This guide includes a set of recommendations that you can use to improve the cost optimization of your Amazon EKS cluster.

## Feedback
This guide is being released on GitHub so as to collect direct feedback and suggestions from the broader EKS/Kubernetes community. If you have a best practice that you feel we ought to include in the guide, please file an issue or submit a PR in the GitHub repository. Our intention is to update the guide periodically as new features are added to the service or when a new best practice evolves.
